    Project: Day's Student-Teaching Blog 

    What is my application about? The application Day’s Student-Teaching Blog will consist of various things. 
    When the website is first open, the user will see a brief background of myself. 
    When you scroll down, student-teachers can rate how they're feeling for their student-teaching.
    Depending how they feel, they will recieve a postive message. 
    When you scroll further, there will be additional quotes to motivate student-teachers during their 
    student-teaching. 
    At the very bottom of the page, I will provide advice on what to do and not to do during their student-teaching.   
    Overall, Day’s 
    Student-Teaching Blog is a community of student-teachers that I will be encouraging.

    <h3>A little bit about me!</h3>
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li>University: Lewis Univeristy in Romeoville, Illinois</li>
        <li>Major: Secondary Education for Mathematics</li>
        <li>Clubs/Sports Involved: Women's Track and Field, Women's Cross Country, & PUMA STEM Program</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How did I become interested in Secondary Education for Mathematics?</h3>
    <p class="p2">As a student, you come to realize the significance an educator has in your life. 
          Besides our teachers teaching us day by day certain material to extend our knowledge, 
          they help us find a purpose within our lives when we don’t see it. They set us up for 
          success within our communities but above all, they teach us to be self-driven and to 
          thrive even after the hardest climb. Furthermore, as a future secondary educator teaching
          mathematics, this is the type of class most students fear and despise due to its level of 
          difficulty. As my love towards this subject grew but continued to have some panic while its 
          complexity increased, my Calculus high school teacher eased off that tension. For instance, 
          on the very first day of school, she made us acknowledged that it wasn’t going to be easy 
          but we were going to work as a team. While she taught us, she managed to teach with enthusiasm, 
          which made this class feel like it was a piece of cake at times. When it came to a difficult unit, 
          she shared her struggles within that area to make sure we didn’t get upset with ourselves or feel 
          any less intelligent. As a result, I was encouraged by her techniques because she created this 
          positive atmosphere within her classroom that students actually wanted to attend her class and 
          master mathematical skills. I desire one day to share the same passion towards this subject, 
          where I can empower those within my future classroom.

    <h3>What is the purpose of Day's Student-Teaching Blog</h3>
    <p class="p3">The purpose is to encourage all student-teachers to continue to strive no matter how difficult things get!
        Additionally, I want to offer any advice from my student-teaching experience.</p>
